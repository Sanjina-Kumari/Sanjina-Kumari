## Hello! üëã

My name is **Sanjina Kumari**, a Computer Science and Economics major at Pacific Lutheran University. I'm passionate about using technology to drive social good, from building web tools and conducting AI research to empowering communities through design and data.

When I‚Äôm not coding or researchin product-market fit, you‚Äôll find me mentoring students, organizing events in my school and community, or brushing up my interior design skills and hiking the Pacific Northwest ‚òï.
